Tips and tricks
---------------
* Selection
    - Hold _Shift_ to include objects into a selection and _Ctrl_ to exclude objects from a selection.
    - Outline a selection area _from-right-to-left_ for adding fully covered objects, and _from-left-to-right_ for adding any touched objects.
    - Use _left mouse button_ or _arrow keys_ to move selected components.
    - Selected components can be removed by pressing Delete key.
    - Press _Ctrl+A_ to select all objects or _Esc_ to reset selection.
* Clipboard and History
    - Clipboard operations are allowed between the models of the same type: _Ctrl+C_ to copy, _Ctrl+X_ to cut and _Ctrl+V_ to insert.
    - History of modifications can be browsed: _Ctrl+Z_ to undo and _Ctrl+Shift+Z_ to redo.
* Navigation and Grouping
    - _Ctrl+G_ combines selected objects into a group and _Ctrl+Shift+G_ ungroups them. 
    - Press _PageDown_ or double-click a group to enter it. Press _PageUp_ or double-clock outside a group to leave it.
    - Scroll the mouse wheel _forward_ to zooms in and _backward_ to zoom out. Alternatively press _+_ to zoom in and _-_ to zoom out.
    - Use the _middle mouse button_ or _Ctrl+right mouse button_ or _Ctrl+arrow keys_ to pan the view.
* Simulation
    - Use _[_ and _]_ keys to navigate through the simulation trace.
    - In Signal-State table the values of excited signals are depicted in bold font.
* Settings
    - Use punf with -r option to replicate Petri net places sensed by read-arcs and speed up the unfolding.
    - Use petrify with -nosi option to allow synthesis of non-speed-independent specifications.
    - Add "-lib tools/petrify.lib" to the petrify options to enable technology mapping into this library.
